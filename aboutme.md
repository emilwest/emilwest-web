My name is Emil Westin and I live in Uppsala Sweden, north of the capital Stockholm.

## My favorite topics
I'm interested in statistics and data science. 

## My tools
- R (3+ years, advanced level)
- Python (3 years, comfortable level)
- SQL (fundamental level)
- Java, C# (4-5 years, comfortable level)
- Bash, unix/linux, regex (7 years, advanced level)

I like R and tidyverse for manipulating data and ggplot for graphing. 
Python is great for machine learning with scikit-learn

## My Education
I hold three different degrees (480 ects) at Uppsala University:
- MSSc Statistics 
- BSSc Statisctis 
- B.A. Computational linguistics

Apart from this, I've also studied 120 credits in Spanish at Link√∂ping University et. al.  
Having lived in Barcelona for over a year I also wrote a thesis in Spanish about the attitudes towards Catalan in the region.


## My experience
- 2016-2020: Computational linguist at Cerence Inc, Nuance Communications and ReadSpeaker
- Currently: looking for data science or statistics jobs in Sweden
