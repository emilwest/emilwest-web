My name is Emil Westin and I live in Uppsala Sweden, north of the capital Stockholm.

##  My favorite topics
I'm interested in statistics and data science.

- R (3+ years, advanced level)
- Python (3 years, comfortable level)
- SQL (fundamental level)
- Java, C# (4-5 years, comfortable level)
- Bash, unix/linux, regex (7 years, advanced level)

I like R and tidyverse for manipulating data and ggplot for graphing. 
Python is great for machine learning with scikit-learn
