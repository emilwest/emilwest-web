My name is Emil Westin and I live in Uppsala Sweden, north of the capital Stockholm.

In my free time, I like to work out. I think health is very important! 
I participate regularly in Uppsala Running Club (Löparklubben) and try to run 30k a week on average. 
Recently I've started to enjoy cooking, I find it fun to experiment with different ingredients and turn it into something delicious.
